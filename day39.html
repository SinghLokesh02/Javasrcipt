<!-- Not Defined V/s Undefined in Javasrcipt -->
<!-- 
    Undefined:

In JavaScript, undefined is a special value that a variable can have when it has been declared but not assigned a value.
When you declare a variable without assigning a value to it, it automatically gets the value undefined.

Not Defined:

When you encounter the term "not defined" in the context of JavaScript, it typically refers to a variable that has not been declared or is not in the current scope.
If you try to use a variable that has not been declared using var, let, or const, you will get a ReferenceError, and the variable is said to be "not defined."



Undefined: The variable has been declared but not assigned a value.
Not Defined: The variable has not been declared, or it is not in the current scope.
